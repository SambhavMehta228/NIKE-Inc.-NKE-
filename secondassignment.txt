In this video, The ChartGuys discuss how to use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to enter trades. They explain that RSI is a momentum indicator that can be used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. When RSI is overbought, it is a signal that the asset may be due for a correction. When RSI is oversold, it is a signal that the asset may be due for a rebound.

The ChartGuys also discuss some of the common mistakes that traders make when using RSI, such as:

    Using RSI in isolation: RSI should not be used in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with other indicators to confirm trade signals.
    Not setting stop-loss orders: It is important to set stop-loss orders when using RSI. This will help you to limit your losses if the trade goes against you.
    Not taking profits: It is important to take profits when using RSI. This will help you to lock in your gains.
